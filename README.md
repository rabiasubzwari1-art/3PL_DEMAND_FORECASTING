3PL Demand Forecasting Project

This project is about forecasting demand in Third-Party Logistics (3PL) using Python and Machine Learning.Demand forecasting helps logistics companies plan transport, storage, fuel, and manpower.

Objectives:
Generate logistics demand data
Analyze demand using graphs
Predict demand using a machine learning model
Show results using a Streamlit web app

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Streamlit

Project Files:
generate_data.py – creates the dataset
logistics_demand.csv – generated data
data_analysis.ipynb – data analysis
app.py – Streamlit application
requirements.txt – required libraries

How to Run:

1)Install libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3)Generate data:
python3 data/generate_data.py
4)Open notebook:
jupyter notebook
5)Run Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

Conclusion:
This project shows how machine learning can be used to predict logistics demand and help companies make better decisions.
